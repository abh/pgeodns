- Use RRDs, RRDp or rrdtool directly instead of RRD::Simple
- Use higher resolution data in rrd file for longer
- Occasionally fetch current version number
- Option to check that the serial number is a recent timestamp
- Generate HTML page with current data
- Generate a small file that can be checked with nagios etc
- Plot response time with query rate (does the response time go up during peaks?)
