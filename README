dinamed
-------

This name server is more or less just a hacked up version of lbnamed
which can be found at http://www.stanford.edu/~riepel/lbnamed/

dinamed is optimized for distributing load to remote hosts for large
"ftp clusters" kinda things. It doesn't (yet) support taking the
actual realtime load on the remote boxes into account.

If you are load balancing a local environment for interactive sessions
you'll probably want to look at lbnamed instead. (It's included in the
lbnamed subdirectory of the dinamed distribution).



Where to get the latest version
-------------------------------

http://sourceforge.net/projects/dinamed/ is your best bet.



Get started
-----------

First you need to get the configuration. If you are running a
nameserver for cpan.org etc, then something like

  rsync --port 7873 -av ddns1.develooper.com::dinamed-conf ~/dinamed/conf/dist/

will get you going. Remember to put that command into cron, running
every 7 minutes or so.


Then to start the nameserver, from the dinamed directory run

 ./dinamed -i [ip|hostname] -l log

or (better)

 ./daemon_wrapper ./dinamed -i [ip|hostname] -l log -n

which will keep the thing running if it should get the silly idea to
die.

The -n parameter makes dinamed not go into the background, which
daemon_wrapper requires.

You can edit the dinamed.rc program to do what you want and just run that.

The interface you specify with the ip address or hostname can't have
another nameserver running as it would already be taking up port
53. You also (obviously) need to run this thing as root so it can bind
to port 53.

Cool stuff
----------

Try

  dig -t txt mgmt.ddns.develooper.com @your-server


Known problems

See the TODO file.


Who did that?
-------------

schemers@eng.sun.com and riepel@networking.stanford.edu wrote the
original lbnamed.

Ask Bjoern Hansen, ask@develooper.com, made dinamed heavily based on
their work.
