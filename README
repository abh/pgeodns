dinamed
-------

This name server is more or less just a hacked up version of lbnamed
which can be found at http://www.stanford.edu/~riepel/lbnamed/


Get started
-----------

From the dinamed directory run

 ./dinamed -i [ip|hostname] -l log

or (better)

 ./daemon_wrapper ./dinamed -i [ip|hostname] -l log -n

which will keep the thing running if it should get the silly idea to
die.

The -n parameter makes dinamed not go into the background, which
daemon_wrapper requires.

You can edit the dinamed.rc program to do what you want and just run that.

The interface you specify with the ip address or hostname can't have
another nameserver running as it would already be taking up port
53. You also (obviously) need to run this thing as root so it can bind
to port 53.

Cool stuff
----------

Try

  dig -t txt mgmt.ddns.develooper.com @your-server


Known problems
--------------

It leaves a core file when you ctrl-c it in debug mode (-d). I haven't
had time to look into that.

It's spewing out an awful amount of debug junk even when
not in debug mode. Oh well.

It doesn't know how to shutdown in a way daemon_wrapper understands,
so making it stop is a pain. 

Depending on your platform, something like

  ps axw | grep dinamed | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kill -9

should do it. =)


Who did that?

Ask Bjoern Hansen - ask@develooper.com - did this.
