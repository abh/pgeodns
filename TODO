dinamed.conf should be fancy modules like the poller stuff.


It leaves a core file when you ctrl-c it in debug mode (-d). I haven't
had time to look into that.


It's spewing out an awful amount of debug junk even when
not in debug mode. Oh well.


It doesn't know how to shutdown in a way daemon_wrapper understands,
so making it stop is a pain. 

Depending on your platform, something like

  ps axw | grep dinamed | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kill -9

should do it. =)



everything should run under -w and use strict.
